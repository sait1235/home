     <h1 align="middle">Russian language</h1>
     <h3>the language of the East Slavic group of the Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family, the national language of the Russian people. It is one of the most widespread languages in the world - the sixth among all the languages ​​of the world in terms of the total number of speakers and the eighth in terms of the number of those who speak it as a mother tongue [9]. Russian is also the most spoken Slavic language [10] and the most spoken language in Europe - geographically and in terms of the number of native speakers [7].

Russian is the official language of the Russian Federation, one of the two official languages of Belarus, one of the official languages of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and some other countries, the main language of international communication in Central Eurasia, Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, one of the six working languages UN, UNESCO and other international organizations [11] [12] [13] [⇨].

The number of people who speak Russian in Russia is 137.5 million people (2010) [5]. In total, about 260 million people speak Russian in the world (2014) [6] [⇨].

The phonological structure of the Russian language is characterized by a historically complicated system of consonantism, which includes 37 consonant phonemes, and a less complex system of vocalism, which includes 5 or 6 [~ 4] vowel phonemes. At the same time, both in the vowel system and in the consonant system, a wide variety of positional modifications is noted. In particular, vowels in an unstressed position are weakened and in some cases do not differ. Stress in Russian is dynamic, variegated and mobile [14] [15] [⇨].

According to the morphological structure, the Russian language is predominantly inflectional, synthetic. The grammatical meaning of tokens is conveyed, as a rule, using inflections. Each inflection usually expresses several meanings at the same time. Along with synthetic forms, the development of elements of analyticism is also observed in the Russian language [14] [⇨].

The syntax of the Russian language is characterized by a relatively free word order, the opposition of one-component and two-component structures of simple sentences, the presence of three types of complex sentences, the active role of intonation means [16] [⇨].

The lexical composition of the Russian language is fundamentally Russian. Means for replenishing the vocabulary fund - the formation of words according to their own models and borrowing. The early borrowings include Slavicisms, Greekisms and Turkisms. From the 18th century, Dutch, German and French borrowings predominate, from the 20th century - Anglicisms [16] [⇨].

The dialects of the Russian language are grouped into two dialects: northern and southern. Transitional Central Russian dialects are localized between the dialects, which have become the basis of the modern literary language [11] [⇨].

In the history of the Russian language, there are three main periods: Old Russian, common for Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian languages (VI-XIV centuries), Old Russian or Great Russian (XIV-XVII centuries) and the period of the national Russian language (from the middle of the XVII century) [17] [ ⇨]. The writing is based on the Old Church Slavonic Cyrillic [⇨].

     <h2>Sociolinguistic information</h2>
     <h3>The Russian language is used not only in those states in which it has an official status. It is relatively widespread in many other countries of the world. As one of the developed world languages, Russian is used in various spheres of international communication, in particular, it acts as a "language of science" as a means of communication for scientists from different countries and as a means of coding and storing universal human knowledge [56]. A rich original fiction, scientific and technical literature has been created on it, much of what has been created by world culture and science has been translated into Russian [36]. According to the Index Translationum, an electronic database of the register of translations, Russian is one of the most actively used languages ​​for translation in the world. Among the languages ​​into which books are translated, Russian is in 7th place. Among the languages ​​from which they are most often translated, Russian is in 4th place [57]. In 2013, the Russian language took the 2nd place among the most popular languages ​​of the Internet [58].

The spread of the Russian language in the world is facilitated by both the political role of the Russian-speaking countries and the importance of the culture associated with the Russian language, primarily Russian classical literature of the 19th century. In many countries of the world, Russian is included in the curriculum of secondary and higher education as a foreign language. Since 1967, the work on teaching the Russian language has been coordinated by the International Association of Teachers of the Russian Language and Literature, which unites about 200 collective members (national unions of Russianists, major universities, etc.). In 1973, the State Institute of the Russian Language named after A.S. Pushkin was created - the most important educational and research center, setting one of its goals to spread the Russian language and culture abroad. In the 1980s, the Russian language was studied outside the USSR in more than 90 countries of the world by 22-24 million schoolchildren, students and others (primarily in Eastern Europe). About 500 million people spoke Russian as a native, non-native or foreign language with different levels of knowledge. In the late XX - early XXI century, as a result of geopolitical changes in the world, there is a significant decrease in the number of people studying Russian as a foreign or foreign language. In the 1990s, the number of Russian language learners outside Russia and the post-Soviet space was estimated at 10-12 million people [</h3>
