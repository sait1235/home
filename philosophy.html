     <h3>Philosophy (ancient Greek φιλοσοφία literally "love of wisdom; love of wisdom") is a special form of knowledge of the world, which develops a system of knowledge about the most general characteristics, extremely generalizing concepts and fundamental principles of reality (being) and knowledge, human being, about the attitude of a person and the world [2] [3] [4]. For centuries, the tasks of philosophy included both the study of the universal laws of the development of the world and society, and the study of the process of cognition and thinking itself, as well as the study of moral categories and values. The ultimate philosophical questions include, for example, the questions “Is the world cognizable?”, “Does God exist?”, “What is truth?”, “What is good?”, “What is a Man?”, “What is primary or consciousness? "," What is the meaning of life? " and others<p>Although sometimes philosophy is defined more narrowly, as a science with a specific subject of study [6], this approach meets the objections of modern philosophers, insisting that philosophy is rather a worldview, a general critical approach to the knowledge of all that exists, which is applicable to any object or concept [7] [8]. In this sense, every person at least occasionally engages in philosophy, that is, reflects</p>Philosophy actually exists in the form of many different philosophical teachings that can oppose each other, but at the same time complement each other</h3>

     <h2>History of the term</h2>
     <h3>The word "philosophy" is borrowed from the ancient Greek philosophers. The famous philologist and historian of antiquity Hermann Diels indicates that the earliest use of the noun φιλοσοφία and the verb φιλοσοφέω in extant texts is found among the historians Herodotus and Thucydides in connection with the nouns σοφός and σοφιστής [11]. Only Socrates turns this word into a special term in a meaning close to the modern one.</h3>

     <h2>The essence of philosophy</h2>
<h3>A socialized person normally possesses an established life-practical worldview [12]. As a rule, it develops spontaneously, relying on the experience of previous generations. However, a person in his life may face problems that his worldview cannot cope with. To solve them, both at the level of a person and at the level of society [13], a higher, critical-reflexive level of attitude to the world may be required. Philosophy is at this level.<p>A socialized person normally possesses an established life-practical worldview [12].

To solve them, both at the level of a person and at the level of society [13], a higher, critical-reflexive level of attitude to the world may be required. Philosophy is at this level.

The precise definition of philosophy is in itself an open philosophical question [8]. This is due to the fact that the subject of study in philosophy is not specifically defined - philosophy considers everything that can be problematized, including the very methodology of cognition (within the framework of epistemology). Within the framework of the teachings of different philosophical schools that have formed during the existence of philosophy, it is possible to give different definitions of what philosophy is. Therefore, in a certain sense, the definition of philosophy depends on the era</p></h3>

     <h3>On the other hand, philosophy has an important unifying principle - any philosophical reasoning, no matter how unexpected its premises, is nevertheless built rationally: meaningfully, in accordance with certain principles of thinking, as an example, logic. Rationality of reasoning distinguishes philosophical thinking from mythological thinking and religious thinking, which implies supranaturalism and the supernatural, that is, the irrational [15] [16] [17]. This, however, does not mean that philosophy does not allow coexistence, for example, with religion. <p>On the contrary, situations are widespread when a religion was accepted as a prerequisite for a philosophical system, and a rational philosophical apparatus was used further to develop those areas of knowledge that were not covered by the canon of this religion [18]. For example, ancient Indian philosophy interpreted the Vedas, and the medieval philosophers of Europe (Blessed Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and others) interpreted the Bible. Cases are also common when philosophical thinking was used to try to prove the justice of a religion or, more generally, to prove the existence of God. For example, apologists have tried to rationalize Christianity.</p></h3>

     <h3>In addition to logic, another method of philosophical thinking ensures the integrity of philosophy. Each new trend in philosophy, new idea or new philosophical school correlates itself with previous philosophical concepts, providing a critical analysis. these concepts within their new paradigm [19]. For example, the famous work of Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, contains a critical analysis of the concepts of rationalism and empiricism. Thus, logic and critical analysis are the pillars of philosophical thinking and provide the integrity of philosophy.

At the same time, the vagueness of the definition of philosophy is its characteristic feature and separates philosophy from sciences. If philosophers in any area manage to make a breakthrough by discovering an effective methodology of knowledge that can be learned without involving philosophy, then this area is usually separated from philosophy into an independent discipline. Thus, the successful application of the scientific method of cognition to various classes of natural objects finally separated from philosophy a part of natural philosophy, which later split into a string of natural sciences [7] [20]. For example, Isaac Newton wrote his fundamental work "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", being, according to his own ideas, a philosopher, and now he is known as a physicist and mathematician. All English-speaking science still retains traces of its relationship with philosophy, for example, in the fact that in all its disciplines the highest scientific degree is called "Doctor of Philosophy" (English Ph.D.) [21].

According to Lenin, expressed in his work Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, “... behind the epistemological scholasticism of empirio-criticism one cannot but see the struggle of parties in philosophy, a struggle that in the last analysis expresses the tendencies and ideology of the hostile classes of modern society. The latest philosophy is as partisan as it was two thousand years ago. The fighting parties, in fact ... are materialism and idealism "</h3>
